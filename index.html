            <h1>Pearl Jam</h1>
            <h3>Scottrade Center</h3>
            <p>Pearl Jam rocked a packed Scottrade Center on October 3 with three exhilarating hours of hits spanning the band's 25-year career. Three hours. Let that sink in. Three freaking hours. That's how long the Gilligan's Island crew was to have been on their doomed boat. That's longer than many baseball games. That's almost enough time to drive across the state to Kansas City. Three hours. An epic set like that is practically unheard of these days, but the grunge gods made sure that every glorious minute counted</p>

                    <h1>Rage Against The Machine</h1>
                    <h3>Alpine Valley</h3>
                    <p>Despite being nearly 10 years since the breakup, the band sounded tight. Zach's vocals were spot on, and Tom Morello, the human killswitch, thrashed about while playing perfectly. A definite performer, most of his solos were performed on top of the monitor. This was no "LIHNERD SKIHNERD FEATURING THE BASSIST OF LYNRD SKYNRD -- THIS SATURDAY AT THE STATE FAIR!" reunion show. This was a band, clearly professional, and clearly there to rock.</p>

                    <h1>Queens Of The Stone Age</h1>
                    <h3>The Pagaent</h3>
                    <p>It was a no-brainer that Queens of the Stone Age's show last night at the Pageant was sold out -- incredibly, it was the band's first St. Louis club show since September 2002. Although a no-frills 90 minutes, the set was exactly what fans expect (and crave) from QOTSA: eardrum-busting volume, sweet riffs and a steamrolling low-end.</p>

                    <h1>The Pixies</h1>
                    <h3>Ryman Auditorium</h3>
                    <p>The band was tight and fresh! The Pixies make some of the best music ever and they are only getting better with time. You can tell they were having a blast even as they worked out a couple minor kinks- after all this was only their second date of the North American tour. Kim's replacement Paz is a natural fit and did a superb job. The Venue is great- just a few thousand of us in a steep configuration means they are all great seats. Easy parking and getting in and out. The beer line was ridiculously long- surely that can be avoided by providing enough staff. Overall a very memorable show!</p>

                    <h1>Ok Go</h1>
                    <h3>The Pageant</h3>
                    <p>OK Go’s concert Saturday night at the Pageant was nothing if not confetti-filled, of course.
                        This is OK Go we’re talking about here, so that sounds just about right.
                        Oh, there was plenty of great music as well. But all those blasts of colored paper, set of  at intervals of nearly every few songs, made the confetti as crucial as any band member o hit song.
                        The pop-rock band’s fun 90-minute concert commenced with a quick flurry of vintage fil  clips including “Scarface,” “The Princess Bride,” “Pretty in Pink,” “The Nutty Professor  and “Damien: Omen II,” a nod to OK Go lead singer Damian Kulash, before a clip featurin   Kermit the Frog brought on the band.</p>

                    <h1>Nine Inch Nails</h1>
                    <h3>Chaifetz Arena</h3>
                    <p>If Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails indeed “Came Back Haunted,” as the title of his recent single states, it’s a haunting that’s scary good, judging by Tuesday night’s concert at Chaifetz Arena.
                    The veteran band conjured up 7,500 fans at the venue, only the third stop on Nine Inch Nails’ “Tension 2013” tour. The band brought to town an as-good-as-it-gets blowout fronted by one of modern rock’s elder statesmen. Reznor, fueled by bassist Pino Palladino, keyboardist Alessandro Cortini, drummer Ilan Rubin, multi-instrumentalist Josh Eustis, guitarist Robin Finck and backing singers Sharlotte Gibson and Lisa Fischer (adding a rare female presence to Nine Inch Nails), tore through a high-pitched two-hour set that blended punk, rock, industrial and EDM sounds.</p>
